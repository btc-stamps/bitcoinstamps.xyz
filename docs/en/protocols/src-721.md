# SRC-721 Recursive NFT Protocol

<SmartStructuredData />

The **SRC-721 Recursive NFT Protocol** enables advanced non-fungible tokens with layered, composable artwork stored directly on Bitcoin. Unlike traditional NFTs, SRC-721 tokens reference multiple on-chain layers to create high-resolution, cost-effective NFTs.

**Protocol Founder:** <EntityMention entity="derpherpstein" variant="cultural">DerpHerpstein</EntityMention> - Community founder and architect of the SRC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, pioneering unique Bitcoin Stamps NFT functionality.

## Key Features

- **Recursive Composition**: NFTs built from multiple pre-stored layer assets
- **Cost Efficient**: Store artwork layers once, reference in multiple NFTs
- **High Resolution**: Support for detailed, multi-layer compositions  
- **On-Chain Metadata**: All data permanently stored on Bitcoin
- **Flexible Minting**: Multiple mint modes and trait allocation systems
- **Counterparty Integration**: Uses stable Counterparty asset IDs

## Creating SRC-721 Collections

**Simple Collection Creation Process:**

### **[Visit Stampchain.io →](https://stampchain.io)** for SRC-721 creation tools

**Step-by-Step Collection Building:**
1. **Design Layers**: Create individual artwork components (backgrounds, characters, accessories)
2. **Upload Layers**: Store each layer as a separate Bitcoin Stamp  
3. **Deploy Collection**: Define collection parameters and pricing using web tools
4. **Set Traits**: Configure how layers combine to create unique NFTs
5. **Enable Minting**: Allow users to mint composed NFTs from your layers

**Benefits for Artists:**
- **Lower Costs**: Store layers once, use in multiple NFTs
- **Higher Quality**: Support detailed, layered artwork  
- **Flexible Design**: Mix and match layers for infinite variety
- **Permanent Storage**: All artwork stored forever on Bitcoin
- **Revenue Streams**: Earn from both individual sales and royalties

**Example Collection Structure:**
- **Background Layer**: Sky, forest, city (3 options)
- **Character Layer**: Different characters (10 options)  
- **Accessory Layer**: Hats, glasses, jewelry (5 options)
- **Total Combinations**: 3 × 10 × 5 = 150 unique NFTs

## Technical Implementation

For developers implementing SRC-721 programmatically:

### Collection Deployment Structure
The protocol uses JSON-formatted data with operations for deploy, reveal, mint, and transfer. Each operation requires specific parameters for collection management and NFT creation.

### Key Technical Features
- **Recursive Composition**: NFTs reference multiple pre-stored stamp layers
- **Cost Efficiency**: Store common elements once, reference multiple times
- **Unlimited Scale**: No file size limits through layer composition
- **Asset Stability**: Uses Counterparty asset IDs for consistency

### Development Resources
- **[OpenStamp Documentation →](https://docs.openstamp.io/)** - Complete SRC-721 implementation guide  
- **[GitHub Examples →](https://github.com/DerpHerpenstein/src-721)** - Code samples and templates
- **[Stamps SDK →](https://github.com/stampchain-io/stamps_sdk)** - Technical integration tools

## Minting Modes

### Public vs Whitelist
- **Public**: Anyone can mint tokens
- **Whitelist**: Only approved addresses can mint
- **Hybrid**: Whitelist period followed by public sale

### Trait Allocation
- **Random**: Traits assigned randomly using seed
- **Authorized**: Collection owner assigns specific traits
- **Mixed**: Combination of random and manual allocation

### Pricing Models
- **Fixed Price**: Set price per NFT
- **Dynamic**: Price changes based on demand
- **Free**: No cost (only network fees)

## Protocol Benefits

### For Collectors
- **Unique Compositions**: Each NFT combines multiple artistic layers
- **Verifiable Rarity**: On-chain trait verification and scarcity
- **True Ownership**: Complete NFT data stored on Bitcoin
- **Unlimited Scale**: No file size limits through recursive composition

### For Developers
- **Efficient Storage**: Reuse layers across multiple NFTs
- **Rich Metadata**: Support for complex attribute systems
- **Scalable Architecture**: Bypass single-transaction size limits
- **Cost Optimization**: Shared layers reduce per-NFT costs

## Real-World Applications

**Gaming Assets:**
- Character customization systems
- Equipment and upgrade components
- Achievement badges and collectibles

**Digital Art Collections:**
- Generative art with trait variations
- Collaborative artwork projects
- Limited edition releases

**Utility NFTs:**
- Access tokens with visual representation
- Membership badges with customization
- Event tickets with unique designs

## Network Integration

SRC-721 integrates with Bitcoin Stamps infrastructure:
- **Counterparty Protocol**: Stable asset ID system
- **Stamps Indexer**: Tracks NFT mints and transfers
- **Layer Storage**: Individual stamps store artwork layers
- **API Access**: Query collections and NFT data via stampchain.io APIs
