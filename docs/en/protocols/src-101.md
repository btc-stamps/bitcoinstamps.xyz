# SRC-101 Name Service Protocol

<SmartStructuredData />

The **SRC-101 Name Service Protocol** enables human-readable domain names directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Developed collaboratively by the **Bitname Team** and **Stamp Team**, SRC-101 solves UTXO-linked asset challenges while providing permanent name resolution.

## Key Features

- **Permanent Names**: Stamped directly onto Bitcoin blockchain for true immutability
- **Universal Address Support**: Compatible with all Bitcoin address types  
- **Account Based Mode**: Eliminates risks of accidentally spending name assets
- **Domain-Like Features**: Full naming service functionality on Bitcoin
- **Second-Layer Ready**: Supports broader Bitcoin ecosystem integration

## Creating Bitcoin Names

**Simple Registration Process:**

### **[Visit Bitname.pro →](https://bitname.pro)** for name registration

**Step-by-Step Registration:**
1. **Choose your name** (1-10 characters, alphanumeric)
2. **Connect Bitcoin wallet** (any compatible wallet)
3. **Pay registration fee** in Bitcoin
4. **Name registered permanently** on Bitcoin blockchain

**Name Benefits:**
- **Easy Recognition**: Use memorable names instead of complex Bitcoin addresses
- **Permanent Ownership**: Names stored forever on Bitcoin blockchain  
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with all Bitcoin wallet types
- **Transfer Capability**: Names can be bought, sold, and transferred
- **Business Applications**: Create branded Bitcoin addresses

## Technical Implementation

For developers implementing SRC-101 programmatically:

### Core Protocol Operations
The protocol supports deploy, mint, setrecord, transfer, and renew operations using JSON-formatted data structures.

### Key Technical Features
- **Account-Based Mode**: Eliminates UTXO management complexity
- **Multiple Record Types**: Support for BTC addresses and custom data
- **Whitelist Collections**: Create exclusive name spaces
- **Permanent Resolution**: Names persist as long as Bitcoin exists

### Development Resources
- **[Bitname API →](https://api.bitname.pro)** - Name resolution endpoints
- **[Documentation →](https://bitname.gitbook.io/bitname/)** - Complete implementation guide  
- **[TX-Builder SDK →](https://github.com/btc-stamps/tx-builder)** - Technical integration tools

## Protocol Benefits

**For Users and Creators:**
- **Simplified Transactions**: Send Bitcoin to "alice.btc" instead of complex addresses
- **Creative Identity**: Build your artistic or business brand with memorable Bitcoin names
- **Permanent Records**: Names persist as long as Bitcoin exists  
- **Universal Resolution**: Works across all Bitcoin applications

**For Developers:**
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for name resolution
- **Flexible Records**: Support multiple record types (BTC, text, etc.)
- **Whitelist Support**: Create exclusive name collections
- **Event System**: Track name registrations and transfers

**Universal Benefits:**
- **True Permanence**: Names stored directly on Bitcoin blockchain
- **Simplified UX**: Human-readable addresses for better usability
- **Ownership Control**: Full control over your name records
- **Network Effects**: Part of growing Bitcoin identity ecosystem

## Real-World Applications

**Personal Identity:**
- Register your name for easy Bitcoin payments
- Create memorable addresses for business use
- Build personal brand on Bitcoin network

**Business Applications:**
- Company domain names on Bitcoin
- Payment processing with human-readable addresses
- Brand protection through name registration

**Developer Tools:**
- Bitcoin-native name resolution APIs
- Wallet integration for friendly addresses  
- DApp development with readable identifiers

## Network Integration

SRC-101 integrates with existing Bitcoin infrastructure:
- **Counterparty Node**: For protocol processing
- **Stamps Indexer**: Tracks name registrations and records
- **Bitname API**: [api.bitname.pro](https://api.bitname.pro) for name resolution
- **Wallet Support**: Compatible with SRC-20 capable wallets

## Permanence Guarantee

Bitcoin Stamps, including all SRC-101 name records, achieve a level of data permanence that is architecturally superior to other Bitcoin-based protocols. This guarantee stems from how Stamps data is stored on the Bitcoin network.

### Why SRC-101 Data Cannot Be Pruned

SRC-101 name registrations and records are encoded directly into the **unspent transaction output (UTXO) set** -- the core dataset that every fully validating Bitcoin node must retain in order to verify new transactions. Because this data resides within outputs that nodes are required to keep, it cannot be discarded without breaking consensus. Any Bitcoin full node, at any point in the future, will hold the complete record of every SRC-101 name deployment, registration, and record update.

### Contrast with Ordinals and Witness Data

Ordinals inscriptions store their data in the **witness** (SegWit) portion of Bitcoin transactions. While witness data is included in blocks, Bitcoin's protocol explicitly allows nodes to prune witness data after validation. A pruned node can discard witness sections entirely and still function as a valid participant in the network. This means Ordinals data availability depends on archival nodes choosing to retain that data -- it is not structurally guaranteed.

Bitcoin Stamps take the opposite approach. By embedding data in the UTXO set rather than witness data, Stamps ensure that every full node -- whether archival or pruned -- retains the data as a mandatory part of consensus operations.

### Practical Implication

Any SRC-101 name record can be retrieved from **any Bitcoin full node, indefinitely**. Your registered Bitcoin name and its associated records persist not because someone chooses to archive them, but because the network structurally cannot discard them. There is no reliance on specialized archival infrastructure, IPFS pinning services, or third-party data availability layers.
