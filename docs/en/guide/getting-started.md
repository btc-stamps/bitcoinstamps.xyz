# Getting Started with Bitcoin Stamps - Begin Network Strengthening

<SmartStructuredData />

Welcome to Bitcoin Stamps - where creative expression meets Bitcoin network strengthening. This guide helps you start contributing to Bitcoin mining economics while creating permanent digital assets that live forever on the world's most secure blockchain.

## Why Bitcoin Stamps Matter for Bitcoin's Future

Bitcoin Stamps represent a fundamental shift from extractive digital art to **Bitcoin network strengthening technology**. When you participate in Bitcoin Stamps, you:

- **Support Bitcoin Miners**: Every stamp transaction generates fees that directly support network security
- **Strengthen Consensus**: Increased transaction volume enhances Bitcoin's decentralized security model  
- **Lock Bitcoin Value**: P2WSH outputs permanently remove Bitcoin from circulation, creating deflationary pressure
- **Build Network Effects**: Real utility drives sustainable Bitcoin network growth

<EntityMention entity="kevin" variant="cultural">KEVIN</EntityMention> guides you through this journey of creative expression that genuinely benefits the entire Bitcoin ecosystem.
