# What are Bitcoin Stamps? Network-Strengthening Digital Assets

<SmartStructuredData />

Bitcoin Stamps are **permanent digital assets** stored directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely on external servers, Bitcoin Stamps embed all data directly into Bitcoin transactions, making them truly immutable and independent.

## What Makes Bitcoin Stamps Special

- **True Permanence**: Data lives forever on Bitcoin, the world's most secure network
- **No Dependencies**: Doesn't rely on websites, servers, or third-party storage
- **Network Strengthening**: Each stamp transaction supports Bitcoin miners through fees
- **Community Values**: Guided by <EntityMention entity="kevin" variant="cultural">KEVIN's</EntityMention> principles of fairness and authentic creativity
- **Technical Innovation**: Advanced metaprotocols built on Bitcoin's solid foundation

## Technical Architecture: UTXO-Based Permanence

Bitcoin Stamps use a fundamentally different approach to data storage compared to other Bitcoin-based digital assets:

### P2WSH Storage Model
Bitcoin Stamps store data using **P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) encoding** directly in the Bitcoin UTXO set:

- **Universal Node Storage**: ALL Bitcoin full nodes store stamp data permanently
- **Consensus Critical**: Data is part of Bitcoin's core validation requirements
- **Unprunable**: Cannot be removed or pruned from the blockchain
- **Built-in Economics**: Stamp creation inherently supports Bitcoin miners

### Why This Matters for Permanence

Unlike witness data approaches, Bitcoin Stamps data is:
- **Required for Bitcoin operation**: Nodes must store UTXO data to validate transactions
- **Protected by consensus**: Part of Bitcoin's fundamental economic and security model
- **Future-proof**: Survives as long as the Bitcoin network exists
- **Self-validating**: No external services or infrastructure required

## Bitcoin Stamps Protocols

### SRC-20 Tokens
Fungible tokens on Bitcoin. <EntityMention entity="kevin" variant="cultural">KEVIN</EntityMention> was the first <EntityMention entity="src-20" variant="technical">SRC-20 token</EntityMention>, demonstrating community-driven development and fair launch principles.

### SRC-101 Names  
Human-readable names for Bitcoin addresses and resources using <EntityMention entity="src-101" variant="technical">SRC-101</EntityMention>, making the ecosystem more accessible.

### SRC-721 Recursion Standard
Advanced recursion capabilities allowing Bitcoin Stamps to reference and combine multiple stamps into composite artwork through <EntityMention entity="src-721" variant="technical">SRC-721</EntityMention>.

### OLGA Encoding
P2WSH encoding optimization that reduces costs across all Bitcoin Stamps protocols via <EntityMention entity="olga" variant="technical">OLGA</EntityMention>.

## How Bitcoin Stamps Strengthen the Network

Every Bitcoin Stamp transaction:
- **Supports Miners**: Transaction fees provide revenue to Bitcoin miners
- **Increases Security**: More transactions strengthen Bitcoin's consensus mechanism
- **Creates Utility**: Real use cases beyond simple value transfer
- **Locks Value**: Some stamp types permanently lock Bitcoin in special outputs

## Protocol Foundation

Bitcoin Stamps are built on the proven <EntityMention entity="counterparty">Counterparty protocol</EntityMention> (established 2014), providing:

- **Battle-tested Architecture**: 10+ years of reliable operation
- **Account-based Asset Model**: Simpler than UTXO tracking approaches
- **Standard Bitcoin Tooling**: No specialized infrastructure required
- **Natural Evolution Path**: Continuous protocol enhancement capability
