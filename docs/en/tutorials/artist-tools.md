## 🎨 Create Your First Bitcoin Stamp

Ready to create permanent digital art on Bitcoin? Use these official tools:

### **[Visit Stampchain.io →](https://stampchain.io)**

## Pre-Creation Checklist

1. **Define your artistic vision** and cultural contribution
2. **Optimize images** under 50KB for reasonable fees (100KB max)
3. **Check network fees** and budget accordingly
4. **Verify Bitcoin balance** in your connected wallet

## Image Optimization Tips

**Size Guidelines:**
- **Recommended**: Under 50KB for cost efficiency
- **Maximum**: 100KB per transaction
- **Formats**: PNG (best quality) or JPEG (smaller files)
- **Resolution**: Optimize dimensions for your art style

**Creative Workflow:**

- Create during off-peak hours for lower fees

**Best Practices:**
- Test with small amounts first
