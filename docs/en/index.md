## The Bitcoin Graffiti Movement

Bitcoin Stamps began as a graffiti movement on Bitcoin - permanent digital art that can't be removed or censored. <EntityMention entity="mikeinspace">mikeinspace</EntityMention>, the original dreamer and visionary founder, connected with <EntityMention entity="arwyn">Arwyn</EntityMention> through the Flooneybin project on <EntityMention entity="counterparty">Counterparty</EntityMention> (a meme based on the icon Joe Looney). When Mike shared his Bitcoin Stamps vision, <EntityMention entity="arwyn">Arwyn</EntityMention> recognized the meme magic potential, leading to the formation of The Original Trinity with <EntityMention entity="reinamora">Reinamora</EntityMention> and subsequently the creation of the first stamp at block 779,652.

From this collaboration emerged <EntityMention entity="kevin">KEVIN</EntityMention> at Bitcoin Stamp #4258 —initially <EntityMention entity="arwyn">Arwyn's</EntityMention> homage to <EntityMention entity="reinamora">Reinamora</EntityMention> and, by extension, the Rare Pepe culture, but destined to become something far greater. Born from esoteric meme magic, it evolved from a simple stamp into a self-replicating ghost in the minting machine, then became the first SRC-20 token at Bitcoin Stamp #18,516 and a beloved community gentleman of memes with over 2,300 holders.

**Essential Foundation**: All SRC-20 tokens are stamps (they create stamp records), but not all stamps are SRC-20 tokens. Stamps are the non-fungible foundation layer, while SRC-20 tokens are the fungible layer built on top.

## Getting Started

**What You Can Create**: Digital art, SRC-20 tokens, SRC-721 NFTs, and human-readable names - all permanently stored on Bitcoin.

### For Creators

Transform your creativity into permanent Bitcoin assets:

- **[Create Your First Stamp →](/en/tutorials/creating-first-stamp)** - Begin with permanent digital art
- **[Artist Tools →](/en/tutorials/artist-tools)** - Creative workflows and tools  
- **[SRC-20 Token Creation →](/en/tutorials/src20-token-creation)** - Build your own tokens
- **[Visual Workflow Guide →](/en/tutorials/visual-workflow)** - Step-by-step visual process

### For Developers

Integrate Bitcoin Stamps protocols into your applications:

- **[Protocol Documentation →](/en/protocols/)** - Technical specifications for all protocols
- **[SDK Integration →](/en/tutorials/sdk-integration)** - Developer tools and libraries
- **[API Reference →](/en/tutorials/api-integration)** - REST endpoints and data access
- **[Complete Tutorial Library →](/en/tutorials/)** - Comprehensive development guides

### Essential Resources

- **[Community Hub →](/en/community/)** - Connect with creators and developers
- **[Bitcoin Stamps History →](/en/narratives/)** - Learn the cultural foundation
- **[Economics Guide →](/en/guide/economics)** - Understand costs and value

## Why Bitcoin Stamps? Superior Technical Architecture

### Consensus-Level Permanence
- **UTXO Set Storage**: Data stored in Bitcoin's consensus-critical UTXO set, not prunable witness data
- **All Nodes Store**: Every Bitcoin full node must store Bitcoin Stamps data for consensus validation
- **No External Dependencies**: Works with standard Bitcoin infrastructure - no specialized indexers required

### Technical Advantages Over Witness Data Assets
- **P2WSH Encoding**: Uses Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash, not witness segments that can be pruned
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Built on Counterparty protocol (battle-tested since 2014), not artificial "sat tracking"
- **Deterministic**: Same results on all nodes - no indexer fragmentation or inconsistencies

### Developer & User Benefits  
- **Account-Based Model**: Simple asset ownership without complex UTXO tracking
- **Lower Risk**: Assets can't be accidentally spent like Ordinals tied to specific UTXOs
- **Fair Community**: Built on fair launch principles and authentic community values

## Community Values

The Bitcoin Stamps community embodies *"In Lak'ech Ala K'in"* - "I am you and you are me" - the understanding that individual creativity strengthens our collective expression. 

Our community carries forward the Rare Pepe tradition while embracing Bitcoin's permanence. From organic growth rather than corporate planning, we've built a movement centered on authentic digital expression, fair launches, and shared creativity. This permanent art movement connects creators across the world through Bitcoin's immutable ledger.
