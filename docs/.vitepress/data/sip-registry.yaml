# Gating criteria between phases
gating:
  - from: 1
    to: 2
    condition: "SIP-0001 live for 2000+ blocks (~2 weeks)"
    rationale: "HTLC must be battle-tested before AMM dependencies"

  - from: 2
    to: 3
    condition: "SIP-0006 Phase 1 stable for 1000+ blocks"
    rationale: "AMM core proven before cross-chain integration"

  - from: 3
    to: 4
    condition: "SIP-0003 bridge operational, security audited"
    rationale: "Bridge custody is high-risk — requires validation"
